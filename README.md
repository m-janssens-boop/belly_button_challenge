# belly_button_challenge

__Overview__
This project uses JavaScript and D3 to explore data from the belly button biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) found in the samples.json file. Within the static folder, logic.js has functions which extract and visualize data by sample id number. The visualizations of the bacterial starins and their prevalence per research subject, and the accompanying metadata of the demographics, age, etc of each reseaarch subject, can be viewed via the webpage of index.html.
